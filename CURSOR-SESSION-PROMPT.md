## üöó LPlate Project Diagnostic & Context Setup

I'm working on **LPlate**, a UK learner driver marketplace connecting learners with qualified driving instructors. Please help me get up to speed by running these diagnostics and providing a comprehensive project overview.

### üìã **Immediate Diagnostics to Run:**

1. **Check Project Status**
   - Run `git status` to see current changes
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
   - Check if dev server is running (`pnpm dev` if needed)

2. **Review Key Files**
   - Read `README.md` for project overview and current features
   - Check `package.json` for dependencies and scripts
   - Review `src/app/page.tsx` for homepage structure
   - Check `src/components/ui/SocialProofCarousel.tsx` for current implementation

3. **Database & Backend Status**
   - Check if Supabase environment variables are configured
   - Review any SQL files in root directory for database setup
   - Check `src/lib/supabase.ts` for client configuration

4. **Known Issues Check**
   - Look for `BUG-*.md` files documenting current issues
   - Check console for any runtime errors
   - Verify social proof system functionality

### üéØ **Project Context:**

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

**Core Features:**
- Enhanced instructor search with advanced filtering and postcode normalization
- Modern segmented toggle controls for vehicle type, gender, duration, and time of day
- Multi-day availability selection with privacy-protected location display
- Price-sorted results with prominent pricing badges and large profile pictures
- Booking system with availability calendar
- Profile management with photo uploads
- Social proof system (learner certificate uploads)
- Role-based authentication (learner vs instructor)

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Enhanced instructor search functionality with modern UI/UX
- Advanced filtering system with segmented toggles
- Privacy protection and user experience improvements
- Social proof carousel displaying learner success stories
- Certificate upload system for learners
- Database schema for social_proof_submissions table

### üîç **Key Areas to Investigate:**

1. **Enhanced Instructor Search System**
   - Verify postcode normalization is working (handles spaces/no spaces)
   - Test segmented toggle controls for all filter types
   - Check multi-day availability selection functionality
   - Confirm price sorting (lowest first) is working
   - Verify privacy protection (masked postcodes, miles display)
   - Test Enter key support in search bar
   - Verify instant search results from homepage (no double-typing)

2. **Instructor Card Display**
   - Check profile pictures are loading correctly (not just initials)
   - Verify pricing badges are prominent and properly formatted
   - Confirm information hierarchy: Name ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Rating ‚Üí Vehicle Type
   - Test responsive design on mobile devices

3. **Social Proof System**
   - Check if learner names are displaying correctly (not "Learner")
   - Verify certificate images are loading
   - Test upload functionality

4. **Database Schema**
   - Verify social_proof_submissions table exists
   - Check RLS policies for storage buckets
   - Confirm test data is properly linked

5. **UI/UX Status**
   - Verify left/right layout in social proof cards
   - Check date format ("DD Mth")
   - Confirm location names are clean (no "Test Centre")

### üìù **Expected Output:**

Please provide:
1. **Project Status Summary** - Current state, recent changes, any issues
2. **Feature Status** - What's working, what needs attention
3. **Technical Health** - Build status, dependencies, environment
4. **Next Steps** - Recommended actions or priorities
5. **Known Issues** - Any documented bugs or limitations

### üö® **Common Issues to Check:**

- Instructor names showing as "Instructor" instead of actual names (FIXED)
- Profile pictures not loading (showing initials instead)
- Postcode normalization not working properly (FIXED)
- Filter toggles not responding correctly
- Price sorting not working (should be lowest first) (FIXED)
- Enter key not triggering search (FIXED)
- Distance showing in km instead of miles (FIXED)
- Postcodes not being masked for privacy (FIXED)
- Homepage search requiring double-typing (FIXED)
- Learner names showing as "Learner" instead of actual names
- Build errors in bookings page
- Supabase connection issues
- Image upload/storage problems
- Authentication/authorization issues
