## üöó LPlate Project Diagnostic & Context Setup

I'm working on **LPlate**, a UK learner driver marketplace connecting learners with qualified driving instructors. **PRODUCTION STATUS: Stripe Connect integration is complete and deployed!** üéâ

### üéØ **Current Status (Latest)**
- ‚úÖ **Stripe Connect**: Fully integrated with production-ready schema
- ‚úÖ **Database**: ChatGPT-improved schema with concurrency-safe credit ledger
- ‚úÖ **Webhooks**: Deployed and processing events successfully
- ‚úÖ **Build**: All TypeScript and linting issues resolved
- ‚úÖ **Deployment**: Live on Vercel with Stripe Connect functionality

Please help me get up to speed by running these diagnostics and providing a comprehensive project overview.

### üìã **Immediate Diagnostics to Run:**

1. **Check Project Status**
   - Run `git status` to see current changes
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
   - Check if dev server is running (`pnpm dev` if needed)

2. **Review Key Files**
   - Read `README.md` for project overview and current features
   - Check `package.json` for dependencies and scripts
   - Review `src/app/page.tsx` for homepage structure
   - Check `src/components/ui/SocialProofCarousel.tsx` for current implementation

3. **Database & Backend Status**
   - Check if Supabase environment variables are configured
   - Review any SQL files in root directory for database setup
   - Check `src/lib/supabase.ts` for client configuration

4. **Known Issues Check**
   - Look for `BUG-*.md` files documenting current issues
   - Check console for any runtime errors
   - Verify social proof system functionality

### üéØ **Project Context:**

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), Stripe Connect

**Core Features:**
- Enhanced instructor search with advanced filtering and postcode normalization
- Modern segmented toggle controls for vehicle type, gender, duration, and time of day
- Multi-day availability selection with privacy-protected location display
- Price-sorted results with prominent pricing badges and large profile pictures
- Booking system with availability calendar
- Profile management with photo uploads
- Social proof system (learner certificate uploads)
- Role-based authentication (learner vs instructor)
- **Stripe Connect Integration**: Complete payment processing with automated payouts
- **Prepaid Lesson Credits**: Multi-hour purchases with automatic deduction
- **Discount & Referral Codes**: Promotional code support at checkout

**Current Focus Areas:**
- **Production-Ready Stripe Connect**: Complete payment processing with improved database schema
- **ChatGPT-Improved Schema**: Concurrency-safe credit ledger and clear payout instructions
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time payment updates using new schema tables (orders, credit_ledger)

- **Admin Dashboard**: Materialized views and comprehensive audit trails
- Enhanced instructor search functionality with modern UI/UX
- Advanced filtering system with segmented toggles
- Privacy protection and user experience improvements

### üîç **Key Areas to Investigate:**

1. **Production-Ready Stripe Connect Integration**
   - Verify webhook endpoints are deployed and processing events successfully
   - Check new database schema is properly migrated (orders, lessons, credit_ledger, payout_instructions)
   - Test payment processing with improved schema tables
   - Confirm automated Friday payout system with lesson completion tracking
   - Verify concurrency-safe credit ledger system (append-only delta_minutes)
   - Test discount and referral code application
   - Check dispute and refund handling with new schema
   - Verify admin dashboard views and audit trails are working

2. **Enhanced Instructor Search System**
   - Verify postcode normalization is working (handles spaces/no spaces)
   - Test segmented toggle controls for all filter types
   - Check multi-day availability selection functionality
   - Confirm price sorting (lowest first) is working
   - Verify privacy protection (masked postcodes, miles display)
   - Test Enter key support in search bar
   - Verify instant search results from homepage (no double-typing)

2. **Instructor Card Display**
   - Check profile pictures are loading correctly (not just initials)
   - Verify pricing badges are prominent and properly formatted
   - Confirm information hierarchy: Name ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Rating ‚Üí Vehicle Type
   - Test responsive design on mobile devices

3. **Social Proof System**
   - Check if learner names are displaying correctly (not "Learner")
   - Verify certificate images are loading
   - Test upload functionality

4. **Database Schema**
   - Verify social_proof_submissions table exists
   - Check RLS policies for storage buckets
   - Confirm test data is properly linked

5. **UI/UX Status**
