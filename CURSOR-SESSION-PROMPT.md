### 🚨 **Session Issues & Lessons Learned (v3.12):**

**Homepage Mobile Optimization Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Social media links were wrapping to multiple rows on 375px mobile screens
- ✅ **Solution**: Changed from `flex-wrap` to single-row layout with `gap-2` spacing and "Insta" abbreviation
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Always test social links on actual mobile widths - wrapping can break layout

**Stats Section Layout Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Horizontal grid layout was cramped on mobile, text was wrapping
- ✅ **Solution**: Converted to vertical stacked cards with horizontal icon-stat-text layout
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Vertical stacking often works better for mobile than horizontal grids

**Stats Alignment Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: `justify-between` was centering statistics in middle space, causing misalignment
- ✅ **Solution**: Used `space-x-6` with `ml-auto` for proper spacing and right-aligned text
- ✅ **Key Learning**: `justify-between` can cause floating elements - use controlled spacing instead

**Text Sizing Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: "Qualified Instructors" text was too long for mobile layout
- ✅ **Solution**: Reduced text sizes from `text-2xl`/`text-sm` to `text-xl`/`text-xs`
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Always test text length on target mobile widths

**Future Prevention:**
- Test all layouts on actual mobile widths (375px) not just responsive breakpoints
- Use controlled spacing instead of `justify-between` for predictable layouts
- Consider text length when designing mobile layouts
- Vertical stacking often better than horizontal grids for mobile

### 🚨 **Session Issues & Lessons Learned (v3.11):**

**Mobile Menu Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Mobile menu was using `absolute` positioning with fixed width, leaving content partially visible behind it
- ✅ **Solution**: Changed to `fixed` positioning with full-screen overlay (`inset-0`) and proper z-index layering
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Always use `fixed` positioning for mobile overlays, not `absolute` - ensures proper full-screen coverage
- ✅ **Animation**: Added smooth slide-in transitions with `transform` and `transition-transform` for professional feel

**Reschedule Modal Enhancement (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: User requested duration dropdown but modal only had date/time fields
- ✅ **Solution**: Added duration state management and dropdown with 1/2 hour options
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Always consider all aspects of a feature request - duration was missing from reschedule flow
- ✅ **UX**: Pre-fill current duration for better user experience

**Code Structure Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Duplicate div elements created during mobile menu refactoring
- ✅ **Solution**: Careful review of opening/closing tags and proper fragment usage (`<>`)
- ✅ **Key Learning**: Always check for duplicate elements when refactoring complex JSX structures

**Future Prevention:**
- Always test mobile overlays with `fixed` positioning and full-screen coverage
- Consider all aspects of feature requests (duration, timing, validation, etc.)
- Use proper React fragments and check for duplicate elements during refactoring
- Test animations and transitions on actual mobile devices for proper UX

### 🚨 **Current Known Issues (v3.5 - Production Deployed & Cleaned):**

**All Major Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ **Syntax Errors**: Calendar page syntax errors resolved with proper TypeScript integration
- ✅ **Unknown Names**: Booking display now shows actual learner names correctly
- ✅ **Data Fetching**: Supabase query joins working properly with type-safe database operations
